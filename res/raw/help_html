<h2>Shogi version 2.7</h2>

Released Feb 4, 2012.

<h3>Shogi Log Files</h3>

Starting from version 2.0, Android Shogi can save and load game logs
in KIF version 1 format, in UTF-8 encoding.  KIF is a widely used
Shogi log format that looks like the following:

<pre>
後手：XXXXX<br>
先手：YYYYY<br>
手数----指手---------消費時間--<br>
   1 ７六歩(77)        <br>
   2 ３四歩(33)        <br>
   3 ２六歩(27)        <br>
   4 ４四歩(43)        <br>
   5 ４八銀(39)        <br>
   6 ３二銀(31)        <br>
   7 ５六歩(57)        <br>
   8 ４二飛(82)        <br>
   9 ６八王(59)        <br>
  10 ６二王(51)        <br>
  11 ７八王(68)        <br>
</pre>

You will find more information about this format by search google for
"<tt>kif 将棋 ファイル</tt>" (most pages are in Japanese, though).

<h4>Saving and Loading Games Played</h4>

When you finish playing a game on Android Shogi, it automatically
saves the log. You can later click on the "Game logs" button on the
start screen to view them. Only the last 30 logs are kept in the list.

<p>You can permanently save some of these logs in the SDcard by 
long-clicking on the log, then pick "Save in sdcard". This will cause 
the log to be saved in file
<tt>/sdcard/ShogiLog/<em>nonsense</em>.kif</tt>,
where <em>nonsense</em> is some illegible string (it's the SHA-1 hash 
of the log, if you are a nerd). The logs saved in the sdcard will have 
marker <strong>[sd]</strong> in the game log list, and they will 
survive even if the Android Shogi is uninstalled.


<h4>Loading KIF and HTML files</h4>

Android Shogi also can show KIF files downloaded from the Internet.
These files must be stored in directory <tt>/sdcard/download</tt> for
Android Shogi to find them (<tt>/sdcard/download</tt> is be the
default download directory used by the Android web browser). The files can be
one of the two formats:

<ul>
<li> A KIF file in UTF-8 encoding (see above).

<li> An HTML file that embeds a KIF inside a
&lt;pre&gt;...&lt;pre&gt;... block.  The file itself must be EUC-JP
encoded.

<p>The EUC-JP HTML format happens to be used by a popular professional Shogi log site,
<a href="http://wiki.optus.nu/shogi/">http://wiki.optus.nu/shogi/</a>.
To download a log from that site, pick a game you want, then save the
"テキスト表示" link to the sdcard by long-clicking on it. For example,

<a href="http://wiki.optus.nu/shogi/index.php?cmd=kif&cmds=displaytxt&kid=7780">
http://wiki.optus.nu/shogi/index.php?cmd=kif&cmds=displaytxt&kid=7780</a>.

</ul>
